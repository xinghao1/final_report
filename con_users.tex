\item\textbf{Governments} specify operational policies and constraints for the system. Governments are also the main source of funding for the system.
\item\textbf{Launch Personnel} ensure all parts fit specifications and are able to fit into designated spaces within launch vehicles.
\item\textbf{Ground Operators} will ensure system is operating as expected and intervene if required.
\textbf{Outpost Crew} will be operating the system from the lunar Outpost or \gls{EVA}.
\item\textbf{Maintenance Personnel} are made up of contractors and client engineers who design the system. They will detect and resolve problems to keep the system operational.
\item\textbf{Trainers} will train ground and mission operators on the operation of the system. They are the experts on the system and will possibly be transferred to support personnel after training of operators is complete.
\item\textbf{Science Team} is made up of researchers who analyze data sent from the \gls{LO} to \gls{GC}.
