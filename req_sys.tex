\subsection{Drivers}
The following five requirements are identified as the key design drivers, which will heavily influence the outcome of system design.

\textbf{S-P-01: The system shall manipulate payloads of up to 10000 \gls{kg} \cite {RFP}.}

The requirement that the payloads shall be up to 10000 \gls{kg} affects the design of all subsystems. This driver influences the materials chosen for the frame, and end-effector. It also affects the types of sensors used on the robotic system and method of locomotion. In addition, design decisions regarding how the system is able to capture/berthing of visiting vehicles and complete Outpost reconfiguration will be influenced by this driver.

\textbf{S-P-02: The system shall apply holding or reaction forces of 200 \gls{N} in any direction \cite{RFP}.}

The requirement that the system shall apply holding or reaction forces of \SI{200}{\N} in any direction is closely related to the EVA and Outpost Repair operations. The design of the end-effector and types of sensors used on the robotic system will be affected by this driver. It also influence the locomotion subsystem as the design of mobility method is affected. And the design of the frame subsystem is naturally affected by this requirement as all these other subsystems changes.

\textbf{S-P-05: The working envelope (work area) of the system shall cover \gls{TBD} \% of the surface area of the Outpost.}

The requirement that the working envelope (work area) of the system shall cover TBD \% of the surface area of the Outpost influences the locomotion and end-effector design, as well as the positioning of sensors to ensure that the sensor subsystem is able to analyze the Outpost in detail. In addition, design decisions regarding how the system is able to reach to the ends of the working envelope would also have to be decided. Naturally, the frame subsystem is affected as the design of the robotic system changes.

\textbf{S-C-01: The system shall have a mass of less than 450 \gls{kg} \cite{RFP}.}

The constraint on mass affects the design of all subsystems. This driver influences the materials chosen for the frame, and end-effector subsystem. Additionally, the method of power supply, the types and amounts of sensors used on the robotic system is affected, as well as the hardware of the data handling, and thermal control subsystem. All these design decisions need to be made to fulfill the overall mass requirement. Moreover, the weight of the whole system will also have an influence on the method of shipment.

\textbf{S-C-04: The system shall have an average power usage of 450 \gls{W} \cite{RFP}.}

The power constraint influences all electrical components of the robotic system. It affects the types of sensors selected, the method of power supply and power backup, as well as the hardware choice of the data handling and processing, and thermal control subsystems. In order to complete all the operations within the power constraint, the mobility method of locomotion subsystem and electrical hardware of the data handling subsystem will also be influenced.
