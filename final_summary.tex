The following document outlines the design aspects and system requirements of the robotic system involved in the development and maintenance of a future lunar Outpost.

The Operation section

The System section

Mechanical, Electrical, Control

Firstly, an overview of the control aspects of each system is briefly tabulated and described. Then, the subsystem control requirements are clearly defined, and sub-categorized appropriately into functional, or performance requirements. Next, the major control trade-offs are discussed, including autonomy, redundancy, the type of control architecture, and the processor. From the trade studies, a decentralized architecture, both hardware and software redundancy, semi-autonomous control and RAD750 processor are selected. Various control block diagrams are then illustrated for each of the relevant subsystems, as well as an overall control block diagram demonstrating the locations and layout of the various components being actively controlled. Finally, the feedback loops of the system are tabulated and described.
